<p id = “third-paragraph”> It’s actually a different day, this time! Who knew? So, I have a confession to make. I already wrote this and was like halfway thru updating the CSS except I got called away to help out Mom with something, and when I came back I accidentally closed Safari, which closed GitHub, and out went all my work. Whoops! I should get the GitHub app, I bet it’s got some kind of auto-save function. Anyway, 2 days agoI was doing my thing, rewatched the KA debugging videos, stressing over whether or not I’d ever be inducted into the FRS like Elon Musk, who I’m pretty sure I don’t approve of because he’s a billionaire, you know, the normal stuff. Then I go into KhanAcademy, and go like halfway through the CSS Layout lesson (I think), and I learn about all kinds of dope stuff, like — oh, wait, about the debugging things. They were using println(), which led me on a search for my ChromeBook’s developer tools, which led me to a <em> GoGuardian </em> article for teachers about how to block students from using things like Crosh. I also learned about the margin border padding content sequence. It is both the most intuitive CSS (topmargin, leftborder), and it actually seems like it’s the path to making stuff look <em> different </em>. It’s the big-time CSS. I also learned about <span> and <div>, which are even more <span id = “moar”> MORE </span> ways to screw with text. Thank you, and I’m out!
